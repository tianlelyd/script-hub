  "content_text": "Channels\nAt Zed we believe that great things are built by great people working together. We have designed Zed to help every individual work faster and to help teams of people work together more effectively.\nOverview\nChannels provide a way to streamline collaborating for software engineers in many ways, but particularly:\n\nPairing – when working on something together, you both have your own screen, mouse, and keyboard.\nMentoring – it’s easy to jump in to someone else’s context, and help them get unstuck, without the friction of pushing code up.\nRefactoring – you can have multiple people join in on large refactoring without fear of conflict.\nAmbient awareness – you can see what everyone else is working on with no need for status emails or meetings.\n\nChannels\nTo open the collaboration panel hit cmd-shift-c|ctrl-shift-c or collab panel: toggle focus.\nEach channel corresponds to an ongoing project or work-stream. You can see who’s in a channel as their avatars will show up in the sidebar. This makes it easy to see what everyone is doing and where to find them if needed.\nYou can create as many channels as you need. As in the example above, you can mix channels for your day job, as well as side-projects in one instance of Zed.\nJoining a channel adds you to a shared room where you can work on projects together.\nSharing projects\nAfter joining a channel, you can Share a project with the other people there. This will enable them to edit the code hosted on your machine as though they had it checked out locally.\nWhen you are editing someone else’s project, you still have the full power of the editor at your fingertips, you can jump to definitions, use the AI assistant, and see any diagnostic errors. This is extremely powerful for pairing, as one of you can be implementing the current method while the other is reading and researching the correct solution to the next problem. And, because you have your own config running, it feels like you’re using your own machine.\nSee our collaboration documentation for more details about how this works.\nNotes\nEach channel has a notes file associated with it to keep track of current status, new ideas, or to collaborate on building out the design for the feature that you’re working on before diving into code.\nThis is similar to a Google Doc, except powered by Zed's collaborative software and persisted to our servers.\nChat\nThe chat is also there for quickly sharing context without a microphone, getting questions answered, or however else you'd want to use a chat channel.\nInviting people\nBy default, channels you create can only be accessed by you. You can invite collaborators by right clicking and selecting Manage members.\nWhen you have channels nested under each other, permissions are inherited. For instance, in the example above, we only need to add people to the #zed channel, and they will automatically gain access to #core-editor, #new-languages, and #stability.\nOnce you have added someone, they can either join your channel by clicking on it in their Zed sidebar, or you can share the link to the channel so that they can join directly.\nLivestreaming & Guests\nA Channel can also be made Public. This allows anyone to join the channel by clicking on the link.\nGuest users in channels can hear and see everything that is happening, and have read only access to projects and channel notes. They can use the Chat as normal.\nIf you'd like to invite a guest to participate in a channel for the duration of a call you can do so by right clicking on them in the Collaboration Panel. \"Allowing Write Access\" will allow them to edit any projects shared into the call, and to use their microphone and share their screen if they wish.",
