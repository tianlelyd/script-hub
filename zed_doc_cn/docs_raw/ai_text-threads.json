You can use custom key bindings and work with multiple cursors, allowing for seamless transitions between coding and engaging in discussions with the language models.</p>\n<p>However, the text threads differ with the inclusion of message blocks. These blocks serve as containers for text that correspond to different roles within the context. These roles include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>You</code></li>\n<li><code>Assistant</code></li>\n<li><code>System</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To begin, type a message in a <code>You</code> block.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Asking a question\" src=\"https://zed.dev/img/assistant/ask-a-question.png\"/></p>\n<p>As you type, the remaining tokens count for the selected model is updated.</p>\n<p>Inserting text from an editor is as simple as highlighting the text and running <code>agent: quote selection</code> (<kbd class=\"keybinding\">cmd-&gt;|ctrl-&gt;</kbd>); Zed will wrap it in a fenced code block if it is code.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Quoting a selection\" src=\"https://zed.dev/img/assistant/quoting-a-selection.png\"/></p>\n<p>To submit a message, use <kbd class=\"keybinding\">cmd-enter|ctrl-enter</kbd>(<code>assistant: assist</code>). Unlike normal threads, where pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> would submit the message, in text threads, our goal is to make it feel as close to a regular editor as possible. So, pressing <kbd class=\"keybinding\">enter|enter</kbd> simply inserts a new line.</p>\n<p>After submitting a message, the response will be streamed below, in an <code>Assistant</code> message block.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Receiving an answer\" src=\"https://zed.dev/img/assistant/receiving-an-answer.png\"/></p>\n<p>The stream can be canceled at any point with <kbd>escape</kbd>. This is useful if you realize early on that the response is not what you were looking for.</p>\n<p>If you want to start a new conversation at any time, you can hit <kbd>cmd-n|ctrl-n</kbd> or use the <code>New Chat</code> menu option in the hamburger menu at the top left of the panel.</p>\n<p>Simple back-and-forth conversations work well with the text threads. However, there may come a time when you want to modify the previous text in the conversation and steer it in a different direction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"edit-text-thread\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#edit-text-thread\">Editing a Text Thread</a></h2>\n<p>Text threads give you the flexibility to have control over the context.\nYou can freely edit any previous text, including the responses from the LLM.\nIf you want to remove a message block entirely, simply place your cursor at the beginning of the block and use the <code>delete</code> key.\nA typical workflow might involve making edits and adjustments throughout the context to refine your inquiry or provide additional information. Here's an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write text in a <code>You</code> block.</li>\n<li>Submit the message with <kbd class=\"keybinding\">cmd-enter|ctrl-enter</kbd>.</li>\n<li>Receive an <code>Assistant</code> response that doesn't meet your expectations.</li>\n<li>Cancel the response with <kbd>escape</kbd>.</li>\n<li>Erase the content of the <code>Assistant</code> message block and remove the block entirely.</li>\n<li>Add additional context to your original message.</li>\n<li>Submit the message with <kbd class=\"keybinding\">cmd-enter|ctrl-enter</kbd>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Being able to edit previous messages gives you control over how tokens are used.
