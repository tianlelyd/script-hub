This isn't tied to your project. You can disable this for your client via the mute_on_join setting.\nCollaborating on a project\nShare a project\nWhen you invite a collaborator to join your project, a new call begins. Your Zed windows will show the call participants in the title bar of the window.\n\nCollaborators in the same project as you are in color, and have a cursor color. Collaborators in other projects are shown in gray. Collaborators that have access to the current project will have their own cursor color under their avatar.\nWe aim to eliminate the distinction between local and remote projects as much as possible. Collaborators can open, edit, and save files, perform searches, interact with the language server, etc. Guests have a read-only view of the project, including access to language server info.\nUnshared Projects\nIf a collaborator is currently in a project that is not shared, you will not be able to jump to their project or follow them until they either share the project or return to a project that is shared.\nIf you are in a project that isn't shared, others will not be able to join it or see its contents.\nFollow a collaborator\nTo follow a collaborator, click on their avatar in the top right of the window.
